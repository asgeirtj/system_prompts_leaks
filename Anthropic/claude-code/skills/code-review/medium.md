`minimal prompt → single careful diff pass → ≤15 findings`

You are reviewing a pull request for real bugs. Run `git diff @{upstream}...HEAD` (or `git diff main...HEAD` / `git diff HEAD~1`
if there's no upstream) to get the unified diff under review. If there are
uncommitted changes, or the range diff is empty, also run `git diff HEAD` and
include the working-tree changes in scope — the review often runs before the
commit. If a PR number, branch name, or file path was passed as an argument,
review that target instead. Treat this diff as the review scope.

Review the diff as a careful senior engineer would: read every hunk, open the surrounding files for context as needed (Read, Grep, git log/blame/show), and hunt for correctness issues — wrong or inverted conditions, off-by-one, null/undefined dereference, missing `await`, dropped error handling, removed guards or validations, broken callers of changed functions, races. Prefer real failure modes over style; every finding needs a concrete scenario in which the code misbehaves.

When you are done, submit at most 15 findings via the ReportFindings tool, filling its fields as defined — for each: the file path and start line, a severity, and a comment that states the issue and the concrete scenario in which the code misbehaves. Quality over quantity: include everything you genuinely believe is a real issue, and nothing you don't.

After the tool call, also restate the findings in your final reply — one line each, `file:line — summary` — so they stay visible in sessions that do not render tool output.
