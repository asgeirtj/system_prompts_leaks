# System Prompts Leaks

Collection of system message instructions for various publicly deployed chatbots.
i.e.
This is a collection of the "secret instructions" that big AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are given to make them behave a certain way. Think of it like the rulebook for how the AI should talk, what it should do, and what it should avoid. The creator of this project has gathered these rules and put them all in one place on GitHub for everyone to see.
